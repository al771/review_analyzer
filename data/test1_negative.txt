The film’s idea of erasing memories is intriguing at first, but it quickly loses appeal. Joel and Clementine’s relationship feels dull and irritating, with Clementine shown as impulsive and unreliable, while Joel comes across as weak for tolerating it. The supporting characters aren’t likable either. The movie tries to be romantic but ends up flat and unattractive. Overall, it left me with a very negative impression.
