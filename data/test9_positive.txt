I never expected to enjoy Twilight, but to my surprise, I really did. The story of Bella moving to a small town and falling for the mysterious Edward pulled me in, and the Cullen family turned out to be charming and intriguing. The film’s atmosphere is strengthened by impressive special effects, beautiful nature, and a strong soundtrack, which create a rich fantasy world. The weak point is the acting—Kristen Stewart’s flat expressions and Pattinson’s stiffness are noticeable—but the supporting cast feels much livelier. Despite these flaws, the movie is captivating, and I’m eager to watch the sequels to see where the story goes.
