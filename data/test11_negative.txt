Twilight is hardly a vampire movie at all—the fangs are just a gimmick, and the story could just as well be about aliens or elves. Instead of exploring fear or horror, it focuses on awkward romance and underdeveloped characters. Kristen Stewart’s flat performance and weak script make the emotions unconvincing, while Pattinson’s brooding vampire appeals mainly through looks rather than depth. The film is full of illogical actions, cringeworthy scenes, and poor world-building. Still, the first part is less awful than its sequels, making it “the best of the worst.”
