Lost Highway immediately immerses the viewer in a cold, anxious atmosphere, where nothing is clear or linear. Lynch leads through fragmented images, sounds, and surreal twists, creating a sense of unfreedom and inner slavery. The protagonist drifts aimlessly, torn between love, oblivion, and rebellion he cannot control. The “highway to nowhere” becomes a symbol of endless wandering without purpose or result. The film radiates deathly stillness and suffocating dread, leaving only coldness and madness behind.
