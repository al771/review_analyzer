I enjoyed the film and will revisit it, mainly thanks to strong acting and witty dialogue. The story contrasts a romantic young bride’s dreams with her stepfather’s obsession with money, status, and appearances, leading to a vulgar, drunken wedding. The film reflects tastelessness, hypocrisy, and the lack of spirituality across society, from ordinary people to the cynical elite. Slepakov adds a bright spot, highlighting attitudes toward culture and money-driven art. Overall, the movie mixes humor and satire with a bitter view of modern morals—laughter through tears.
