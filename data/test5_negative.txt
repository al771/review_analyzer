Lost Highway carries the same strange, mystical atmosphere I felt in Lynch’s Eraserhead, and that part I enjoyed. The soundtrack is outstanding, with Bowie, Marilyn Manson, and Rammstein adding real power—I even saved a couple of tracks. But beyond the atmosphere and music, the film falls flat. The story feels meaningless, the mystery unengaging, and most characters dull, aside from one eerie figure who deserved a better thriller. I’d recommend watching this film mainly for the music and mood, not for the plot.
