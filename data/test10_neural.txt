Twilight struck me as both dumb and hilarious, yet oddly enjoyable. The story of Bella and Edward is filled with strange dialogue and questionable love dynamics, but its absurdity makes it funny rather than irritating. The film looks beautiful, with striking visuals and an aesthetic that still attracts attention. I actually appreciate Kristen Stewart’s subtle acting, despite the jokes about her expressionless face, and Pattinson fits the role well. Overall, it’s a ridiculous yet entertaining movie that I can’t help but like.
