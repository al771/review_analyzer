Gorko! is one of the worst examples of Russian cinema. The story of Natasha and Roma’s wedding quickly turns into crude stereotypes of Russians as drunks and fools. Humor is tasteless, relying on toilet jokes and vulgarity, which feels embarrassing rather than funny. Direction and camerawork are poor, with clichéd shots and no artistic value, while attempts at spectacle fall flat. Overall, the film demeans Russian culture and offers nothing of worth, deserving its low rating.
