Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind impressed me with its cast and acting, especially Jim Carrey stepping outside comedy and Kate Winslet’s unpredictable character. Yet, despite strong performances, the story felt tangled and overcomplicated, with too many twists weighing it down. While the visuals of Joel’s inner world are inventive and realistic, the characters and relationships don’t truly engage. For me, the film lacks a spark and leaves only the impression of an average one-time watch, rather than a lasting masterpiece.
