Ari Aster once again stumbles outside his signature horror, this time with satire. The film suffers from the same problems as Beau Is Afraid: overlong runtime, bloated storytelling, and lack of focus. Attempts at social satire on pandemic and BLM themes feel forced and outdated, with a few jokes scattered in an otherwise sluggish 2.5 hours. Despite a stellar cast—Phoenix, Pascal, Stone, Butler—the roles are thin and forgettable, wasted potential. The movie has occasional good shots and moments, but overall feels like another overambitious, unfocused misfire from Aster.
